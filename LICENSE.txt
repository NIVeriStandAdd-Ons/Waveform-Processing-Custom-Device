NI DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITIES FOR AND MAKES NO WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE THIRD-PARTY ADD-ON PRODUCTS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE) OR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, so these limitations may not apply to you. You may have other rights that vary by jurisdiction.

If you are a news publication agency, NI grants to you and you accept from NI a limited, nonexclusive, world-wide license and right to copy, distribute, publish, and display (collectively referred to as "Use") datasheets, images, press materials, white papers and FAQs that NI supplies to you through this Site (collectively, "Copyrightable Works"). A "news publication agency" is defined as an organization whose primary function is summarizing and analyzing news and which publishes, on a regular periodic basis, media containing news articles of opinion, features, and advertising. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved to NI. Your right to use the Copyrightable Works is limited to Use in trade journals, newspapers, magazines, news publishing websites, and other publications maintained by news publication agencies. Notwithstanding the rights granted to you above, in no event may you Use the Copyrighted Works in any manner that (in NI's opinion) defames, tarnishes, or otherwise injures the reputation of NI.
